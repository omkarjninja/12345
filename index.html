    <h1>1. What is implicit conversion? Give an example.</h1>
    <br />
    <p>
      Implicit conversion in Python refers to the automatic conversion of one
      data type to another by the Python interpreter without explicit
      instruction from the programmer. This typically occurs when an operation
      or expression involving different data types is performed, and Python
      automatically converts the data types to make the operation valid.

      Write a short note on conditional branching statements supported by Python
    </h1>
    <br />
    <p>
      if statements: The 'if' statement is the most basic form of conditional
      branching in Python. It allows a block of code to be executed only if a
      specified condition is true. If the condition evaluates to false, the
      block of code is simply skipped.
      <br />
      if-else statements: The 'if-else' statement extends the functionality of
      the 'if' statement by providing an alternative block of code to execute
      when the condition evaluates to false. This construct enables the program
      to make binary decisions based on the truth value of the condition.
      <br />
      if-elif-else statements: The 'if-elif-else' statement allows for the
      evaluation of multiple conditions in sequence. It provides a series of
      conditions to test, and the corresponding block of code associated with
      the first true condition is executed. This construct is particularly
      useful when there are several mutually exclusive conditions to consider.
      <br />
      Nested if statements: Nested if statements involve placing one 'if'
      statement inside another. This allows for more complex branching logic by
      creating hierarchical conditions. Nested if statements can be used to
      implement multi-level decision-making processes.

      Can a function call another function? Justify your answer with the help of
      an example
    </h1>
    <br />
    <p>
      Yes, in Python, a function can call another function. This is a common and
      useful practice in programming, especially for organizing code into
      smaller, reusable components. When one function calls another function, it
      means that the execution of the program moves from the calling function to
      the called function, and once the called function completes its execution,
      the control returns back to the calling function.

      def greet(): print("Hello!") <br />def main(): print("Start of main
      function.") greet() # Calling the greet function from within the main
      function print("End of main function.") # Call the main function to start
      the program main()
